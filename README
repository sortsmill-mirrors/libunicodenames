LibUnicodeNames ---------------

LibUnicodeNames makes it easy for your program to retrieve the
information contained in the `names list' file that is published by
the Unicode Consortium at
http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.html

LibUnicodeNames is intended to replace the libuninameslist library
(http://libuninameslist.sourceforge.net/), providing better handling
of locales. In particular, LibUnicodeNames makes it easier to use the
French translation of the names list
(http://hapax.qc.ca/ListeDesNoms-5.0.0.txt), using it automatically if
the current domain is French.

To build LibUnicodeNames one needs a C99 compiler, preferably GNU C
version 4.0 or greater. The following GNU programs are recommended but
not necessary for building and using LibUnicodeNames: GNU Make, Gawk,
Wget, and help2man.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.


Using LibUnicodeNames ---------

LibUnicodeNames includes support for pkg-config
(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/); it will appear
under the package name `libunicodenames'.

To use LibUnicodeNames without pkg-config, use the `-lunicodenames'
linker flag or the `libunicodenames.la' libtool archive file.
