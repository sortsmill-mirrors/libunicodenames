.Ft "char *"
.Fn uninm_find_blocks_db "const char *locale_base"
.Ft uninm_blocks_db

.Ft "const char *"
.Fn uninm_block_name "uninm_blocks_db handle" "int i"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn uninm_find_blocks_db
function returns the path of the blocks database for the current
locale. The caller should call
.Fn free 3
on the string when done with it.
If
.Pa locale_base
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then use it as the base directory for MO (compiled gettext) files;
otherwise use the compiled-in locale directory.
Databases accessible through the compiled-in directory are
.Pa "%%pkgdatadir%%/en.blocks-db"
and
.Pa "%%pkgdatadir%%/fr.blocks-db" ,
corresponding to English and French locales, respectively.
.Pp
The
.Fn uninm_blocks_db_open
function open a blocks database, given its path, returning an opaque
pointer to act as a handle.
.Pp
The
.Fn uninm_blocks_db_close
closes a blocks database, given its handle.  Afterwards the value of
.Pa handle
is meaningless.
.Pp
FIXME: Write documentation here for
.Fn uninm_num_blocks ,
.Fn uninm_block_start ,
.Fn uninm_block_end ,
and
.Fn uninm_block_name .
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, the
.Fn uninm_find_blocks_db
function returns a pointer to a null-terminated string, which
eventually should be freed by calling
.Fn free 3 .
On failure,
.Fn uninm_find_blocks_db
returns
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
On success, the
.Fn uninm_blocks_db_open
function returns an open handle for a blocks database. On failure, it returns
.Dv NULL .
